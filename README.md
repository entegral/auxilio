# Auxilio

#### by Robert Bruce

Latest Deployment can be found [here](https://heretoauxilio.firebaseapp.com/?action=#/profile).

## Project Proposal

Auxilio is here to help you manage your workforce. It provides you with a platform to effectively manage and coordinate your constituents. Auxilio accomplishes this through the use of: 
  * Organization of consitituents into **_departments_**
  * Delegation of responsibilities via the promotion of individuals to 'Department Leads' or 'Organization Leads'
  * Custom forms, enabling the collection of information necessary to running your Org
  * Forum/message board to broadcast _**updates**_
      * Updates can contain forms, written content or documents 
      * Updates serve as a clear timeline of communication
      * Updates can only be broadcast by managers and department leads
      * All constituents can comment on an update
  * Job board where Organization and Department Leads can post jobs in one of three ways:
      * Traditional application style
      * Registered for an open-signup process
      * Special appointment

## Planned State

### Login - Stateful Presentational Component
This component will need to be stateful due to the nature of the login process I have chosen. The component will store a user's email and password (and password confirmation if the user is new) and will have to make an initial API call to firebase to receive their fb-issued UID. This UID will then be used to make a second API call to a Ruby on Rails server, used to host the complex relational data used internally.

### Profile - Stateful Container Component
This component will also need to be stateful so it can pass down the relevant user-information displayed within its presentational child-components. 

### Organization - Stateful Container Component
This component will need to be stateful because it will request information from the RoR server that is relevant to the organization it represents (i.e. updates, Managers, Departments, etc.). It will likely have both presentational and container child-components.

### Header - Stateful Presentational Component
This component will be stateful so it can properly detect/display relevant links based upon the user's logged-in status and permission access-level.

### App - Stateless Container Component
This component could be used statefully, however, most of its child components have different concerns and can be hooked directly to their relevant state-slices.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* A new user can create a new Organization/Camp/Group or join an existing Org/Camp/Group
  * Upon creation, user becomes "Manager" of the Org/Camp/Group
  * Upon joining an existing group, the Auxilio user is added to that group's "volunteer pool"
* Manager Role Features:
  * Organization Enrollment Policy
  * Manager can establish either an Open or Closed (secret) enrollment process
      * open means any Auxilio user can signup without permission
      * closed means an Auxilio user must have a password to register with the group 
  * Departments
    * Can create, update or delete departments
    * Organizations will always have one default department called "Admins"
    * Members of the Admin department will have permissions equal to the manager role
    * Manager/Admins can appoint one or more users enrolled in the group's volunteer pool to a Department Lead Role
    * Department Lead Roles will have privileges similar to the Manager Role, but within the scope of their department
  * Volunteer Pool Job Signups / Registration Features 
Manager will choose a timeframe that volunteers can self-register for available volunteer shifts / opportunities
manager can override and modify ANY volunteer registration or Department Lead appointment
  * Posting
Only Manager and those in the Admins department can add posts to the Organization's main page 
  * Forms
    * Can create forms necessary for collecting information from users (beyond generic info collected when user registers with Auxilio
    * Can generate reports using information generated by form results
      * Can check status of all registered candidates' form results
      * Can generate reports using all the registered volunteer/camper data
* Department Lead Role:
  * Can create lists of job roles needed for their department
    * Jobs can be labeled as "open for registration" which allows volunteers to sign up for them when the registration window opens
    * if not labeled 'open', the position must be manually assigned with someone from the candidate pool
  * Can make Posts:
    * Can post information about their department to their department-specific page
    * Can post information about their department to the Organization's main page 
  * Forms:
    * Can create forms collecting info from users that are in their department
    * Can create forms collecting info from ALL users in the organization
    * Can generate reports using data collected from these forms
* Candidate Pool Members:
  * Are enrolled with an organization
  * Can update their user information
  * Can update their Organization-specific information
  * Can register for a volunteer job/position during the registration window
  * Can comment on posts made by managers or department leads

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* React

* Rails - stretch goal

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Data persistence
* manipulation of data and generation of reports based on existing data
* API Security
* Oauth
* cycling API keys
* include api calls to manipulate data server-side with functions
* include api calls for CRUD methods

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* Rails API Server
